								your customers exciting ways to earn points and keep them engaged with your store.</p>
						</section>

						<section id="section-1-2">
							<h3 class="mt-0">1.1. Points program overview</h3>
							<p>
								Rewarding your customers with points for certain actions is a great way to boost their
								engagement with your store.

								To manage the rules for how customers can earn points,</p>
								<p>Go to the <strong>Reward
									Program</strong>. There, you’ll find all the point earning actions we offer.</p>

							<img src="assets/images/doc/editpoint.png" alt="">
							<p>2. Each earning point option has a switch button to activate or deactivate specific
								programs as you choose.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Active:</strong>These are the rules that allow your customers to earn points
									and are visible on your widget or loyalty page.</li>
								<li><strong>Inactive:</strong> These rules do not allow customers to earn points and
									will be hidden from your widget or loyalty page.</li>

						<section id="section-1-4">
							<h3>1.3 Rewards on purchase</h3>
							<p>1. "Rewards on Purchase" feature allows customers to earn points every time they make a
								purchase. You can set specific point values for different purchase amounts, encouraging
								repeat buying and increasing customer loyalty. </p>
							<img src="assets/images/doc/rewardpurchase.png" alt="">
							<p>In the "Rewards on Purchase" feature of your loyalty app, you have two options for
								rewarding customers:
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Every $1 Spent = 1 Points:</strong> This option allows you to reward customers
									based on how much they spend.
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Example 1:</strong> A customer makes a purchase of $10. He will earn
											= 10 dollars × 1 point per dollar = 10 points..</li>
										<li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Another customer makes a purchase of $100. He
											will earn 100 dollars × 1 point per dollar = 100 points.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><strong>In this system,</strong> the points are directly equal to the amount of
										money spent. For every dollar spent, the customer earns one point. The more a
										customer spends, the more points they earn.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Fixed Amount of Points:</strong>
									With this option, you can reward customers with a set number of points regardless of
									the purchase amount. For instance, no matter how much a customer spends, they will
									receive a fixed amount of points for each transaction.
									<p>Let’s say you set a fixed rule where customers will earn 100 points per
										transaction, no matter how much they spend.
									<ul>
										<li>Suppose, X makes a purchase of $10 for a product.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Since the fixed rule says X will always get 100 points for any transaction:
									<ul>
										<li>X spends $10 → he earns 100 points.</li>
										<li>If X spends $50, he still earns 100 points.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><strong> In this system,</strong> the number of points doesn’t change based on
										how much X spends; it's a fixed reward for every purchase, regardless of the
										total amount.</p>
									</p>
									</p>

								</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>1.4 Birthday rewards</h3>
							<p>1. "Birthday reward" feature is a great way to make customers feel special and
								appreciated, encouraging them to shop with you around their birthday. </p>
							<img src="assets/images/doc/birthday.png" alt="">
							<p>2. Your store offers 50 bonus points as a birthday reward.</p>

							<p><strong>Customer’s Birthday: </strong> X’s birthday is on April 10th.
								On her birthday, X receives 50 bonus points added to her loyalty account automatically
								as a gift from your store.</p>

							<p><strong>How It Works: </strong>X can use these 50 points towards a future purchase, just
								like any other points she earns from shopping.
								This makes her feel special and encourages her to shop again, using her birthday reward.
								This type of reward shows appreciation for customers and can help increase engagement
								with your store.</p>

						<section id="section-1-6">
							<h3>1.5 Social media rewards</h3>
							<p>1. "Social media rewards" feature is a great way to make customers engaging with your store on social media. Customers can earn points for actions like following your social media accounts, sharing your products, or liking your posts. This not only encourages customer loyalty but also helps increase your brand’s visibility online. You can easily set up these social media rewards in the app and start boosting your online engagement! </p>
							<img src="assets/images/doc/social.png" alt="">
							<p>2. Here's how to set it up:</p>

							<h3>2. Ways to redeem points</h3>

						 <section id="section-2-1">
							<h3>2.1. Purchase discount</h3>
							<p>This feature allows customers to redeem their points for a discount on their purchases. The discount is based on a points-to-dollar conversion that you set, along with a few additional rules like minimum order value and maximum discount percentage.</p>
							<p><strong>How Purchase Discount Works:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>1. Points Value:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>You can set reward name with "set name".</li>
									<li>You can set how many points are needed to give a discount.</li>
									<li> <strong>Example:</strong> For every 100 points, the customer will receive $1 off their purchase.</li>
								</ul>
								<img src="assets/images/doc/redeem1.png" alt="">
							</p>
							<p><strong>2. Minimum Order Value:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Customers need to meet a minimum order value before they can redeem their points for a discount.</li>
									<li> <strong>Example:</strong> In this case, the customer needs to spend at least $50 to be eligible for a discount.</li>
								</ul>
								<img src="assets/images/doc/redeem2.png" alt="">

							<p><strong>3. Summary</strong>

							<h3>2.2. Free shipping</h3>
							<p>This "Free Shipping Coupon" option allows you to reward customers by offering free or discounted shipping in exchange for loyalty points.</p>
							<p><Strong>1. Points Cost: </Strong>This is the number of points a customer must redeem to receive a free shipping coupon.</p>
							<p><Strong>2. Set a Maximum Shipping Amount: </Strong>You can set a limit on the shipping value that the coupon will cover. For example, if the maximum shipping amount is set to 1 BDT, the free shipping coupon will cover shipping costs up to 1 BDT.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Let’s say you set the Points Cost to 100 points, and the Maximum Shipping Amount to 50 BDT.</li>
								<li>If a customer redeems 100 points, they can get a free shipping coupon that covers shipping fees up to 50 BDT.</li>
								<li>If their shipping cost is 40 BDT, the entire cost will be covered. However, if the shipping cost is 60 BDT, the coupon will only cover 50 BDT, and the customer will need to pay the remaining 10 BDT.</li>
							</ul>
							<img src="assets/images/doc/shipping.png" alt="">
							<p><Strong>3. Reward Expiration for Free Shipping Coupon </Strong>In this section, you can choose whether the free shipping coupon reward should have an expiration date or remain valid permanently. You have two main options:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li> <strong>No Expiration: </strong>Select this option if you want the free shipping coupon to remain valid permanently. Customers will be able to redeem the coupon at any time without a set expiration date.</li>
								<li> <strong>Set Expiration Period: </strong>If you prefer to limit how long the coupon is valid, select this option and choose a specific expiration period (e.g., 10 days, 30 days, etc.). This ensures that the coupon can only be used within the specified timeframe, encouraging customers to use the reward promptly.</li>
