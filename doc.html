							<p>
								Thank you for choosing the Reward Race loyalty program! With
								our program, you can offer your customers exciting ways to
								earn points and keep them engaged with your store.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Reward Race program is a fun and engaging loyalty system
								designed to help merchants reward customers for their actions.
								It encourages customers to interact with your business, earn
								points, and compete for exciting rewards.

							<h3>1.1. What is the reward race program ?</h3>
							<p>
								The Reward Race program is a fun and engaging loyalty system
								designed to help merchants reward customers for their actions.
								It encourages customers to interact with your business, earn
								points, and compete for exciting rewards.

							<h3>1.2. What makes us unique</h3>
							<p>
								Our system offers
								<strong>four key features— Reward Program, VIP Program, Referral
									Program, and Survey Program—</strong>
								designed to help merchants easily reward their customers and
								boost engagement. Here's how each feature works and how you
								can use them to award points:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>1. Reward Program: </strong>Encourage everyday
									customer actions like purchases or social media
									interactions.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Example: </strong>A customer spends $50 at your
									store and earns 500 points, which they can later use to get
									a 10% discount.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>1. VIP Program: </strong>Reward your most loyal
									customers with exclusive benefits. Set different VIP tiers
									(e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum) based on customer spending or
									points earned. Offer extra rewards, such as bonus points,
									early access to sales, or special gifts for higher tiers.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Example: </strong>A customer who earns 1,000 points
									in a month qualifies for the Gold tier and receives double
									points on all purchases for the next month.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>1. Referral Program: </strong>Grow your customer
									base through word-of-mouth marketing. Provide customers with
									a unique referral code or link. When someone uses their code
									to make a purchase, both the referrer and the new customer
									earn points.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Example: </strong>A customer refers a friend who
									spends $30. The customer earns 300 points, and the friend
									gets a welcome bonus of 100 points.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>1. Survey Program: </strong>Collect valuable
									feedback while rewarding customers for their input. Create
									surveys about your products or services. Offer points to
									customers who complete the surveys, encouraging
									participation.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Example: </strong>A customer fills out a feedback
									form about their shopping experience and earns 50 points.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</section>

						<section id="section-1-3">

									referrals, and more. Stay updated on every interaction
									within your program.

									offline analysis. Keep your workflow efficient and
									organized.

									directly on your website. Promote your loyalty program
									effortlessly.

									rewards, and exclusive offers, driving continued engagement.

							<h3>2.2.1. Order Discount</h3>
							<p>Order discounts are a great way to encourage customers to make a purchase by offering
								them a special discount on their order. To set up an order discount, follow these steps:
							</p>
							<p><strong>1. Create a Discount Code:</strong> Start by entering a unique discount code that
								customers will need to apply during checkout to receive their discount. This code can be
								shared via email, social media, or other communication channels.</p>
							<p><strong>2. Choose the Discount Type:</strong>We offer two types of discounts:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Fixed Amount Discount:</strong> For example, you could offer a discount of
									$10 off a customer’s order. In this case, the discount amount is fixed, regardless
									of the total order value.</li>
								<li><strong>Percentage Discount:</strong> For example, if you set a 10% discount, and
									the customer’s total order is $50, they will receive a $5 discount. The discount is
									calculated as a percentage of the total order amount.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>3. Set Discount Amount:</strong> If you select a fixed amount, you’ll need to
								specify the discount value (e.g., $10). If you choose a percentage, you’ll need to
								specify the discount percentage (e.g., 10%). Remember that these two options are
								directly related to the order total or percentage chosen.</p>
							<p><strong>4. Minimum Order Value:</strong> You’ll also need to set a minimum order value.
								This means customers must reach a certain order amount before they can use the discount.
								For example, you can set a minimum order value of $50, which means customers can only
								use the discount if their total purchase is greater than or equal to $50.</p>
							<p><strong>Example:</strong> Let’s say you offer a 15% discount on orders over $50. A
								customer purchases a product worth $100 and applies the discount code. They will receive
								a $15 discount (15% of $100), making their total $85 (before taxes and shipping). </p>
							<img src="assets/images/doc/discount-1.png" alt="">
							Here are concise tips for setting up effective order discounts:
							<div class="tips">
								<h4>Quick Tips for Order Discounts:</h4>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Use catchy codes:</strong> Create memorable and simple discount codes
										like "SAVE10" or "WELCOME15" for easy sharing.</li>
									<li><strong>Combine discounts strategically:</strong> Pair order discounts with free
										shipping to boost customer interest.</li>
									<li><strong>Test minimum order values:</strong> Experiment with different thresholds
										to maximize sales while maintaining profitability.</li>
									<li><strong>Highlight savings:</strong> Clearly show customers how much they’ll save
										to encourage purchases.</li>

							<h3>2.2.2. Free Shipping</h3>
							<p> The "Free Shipping Coupon" feature allows you to reward loyal customers by offering free
								or discounted shipping in exchange for their loyalty points. This encourages repeat
								purchases while minimizing shipping costs for your customers. </p>
							<h4>How to Set It Up:</h4>
							<p><strong>1. Points Cost:</strong> Determine how many points a customer must redeem to
								claim a free shipping coupon.</p>
							<p><strong>2. Maximum Shipping Amount:</strong> Specify the maximum shipping value that the
								coupon will cover. For instance, if the maximum amount is set to $10, the coupon will
								cover shipping costs up to that limit.</p>
							<h4>Example:</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>You set the Points Cost to 100 points and the Maximum Shipping Amount to $10.</li>
								<li>If a customer redeems 100 points, they receive a free shipping coupon worth up to
									$10.</li>
								<li>If the shipping cost is $8, the entire cost is covered. However, if the shipping
									cost is $12, the coupon will cover $10, and the customer will pay the remaining $2.
								</li>
							</ol> <img src="assets/images/doc/shipping2.png" alt="Free Shipping Example" />
							<h4>Additional Settings:</h4>
							<p><strong>3. Choose Country:</strong> You can specify where the free shipping coupon
								applies. Select one or more countries, or choose all countries. You can also deselect
								countries after selection if needed. This ensures you can tailor your rewards to
								specific regions or a global audience.</p>
							<img src="assets/images/doc/shipping1.png" alt="" />
							<div class="tips">
								<h4>Quick Tips for Free Shipping Rewards:</h4>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Be strategic with limits:</strong> Set a maximum shipping amount to
										manage costs while still offering value.</li>
									<li><strong>Promote it clearly:</strong> Highlight the free shipping reward in your
										marketing to attract and retain customers.</li>
									<li><strong>Focus on key regions:</strong> Offer free shipping to specific locations
										where it's cost-effective and impactful.</li>
								</ol>

							<h3>2.2.3. Free Product</h3>
							<p>The "Free Product" settings allow you to reward loyal customers by offering free
								products, such as a "Buy One Get One" offer.</p>
							<h4>How to Set It Up:</h4>
							<p><strong>1. Discount Name:</strong> Create a unique name for your free product discount to
								make it easily identifiable.</p> <img src="assets/images/doc/product.png"
								alt="Free product" />
							<p><strong>2. Choose the Discount Type:</strong> You can select one of the following
								discount types:</p>
							<ul>
								<li> <strong>Fixed Amount Discount:</strong> Offer a specific monetary discount, such as
									$10 off a customer’s order. This discount applies as a fixed value, regardless of
									the order total. </li>
								<li> <strong>Percentage Discount:</strong> Offer a discount as a percentage of the total
									order value. For example, a 10% discount on a $50 order will give the customer $5
									off. </li>
							</ul>
							<img src="assets/images/doc/product-1.png" alt="Discount type example" />
							<p><strong>3. Choose Applicable Categories:</strong> Specify where the discount can be
								applied:</p>
							<ul>
								<li> <strong>Specific Collection:</strong> Apply the discount to an entire product
									collection. For example, offer $10 off all products within a specific collection. If
									a fixed amount is selected, this discount applies across all eligible products in
									the chosen collection. </li>
								<li> <strong>Specific Product:</strong> Apply the discount to one or more selected
									products. For example, set a 10% discount on specific products only. </li>
							</ul> <img src="assets/images/doc/product-2.png" alt="Applicable category example" />
							<div class="tips">
								<h4>Quick Tips for Free Product Rewards:</h4>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Choose appealing products:</strong> Select popular or complementary
										items to encourage customers to redeem points.</li>
									<li><strong>Promote BOGO deals:</strong> Offer “Buy One, Get One Free” on
										high-demand items to boost sales and loyalty.</li>

										seasonal or surplus inventory to manage costs effectively.</li>
