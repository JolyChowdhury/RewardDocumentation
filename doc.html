							<p>
								Thank you for choosing the Reward Race loyalty program! With
								our program, you can offer your customers exciting ways to
								earn points and keep them engaged with your store.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Reward Race program is a fun and engaging loyalty system
								designed to help merchants reward customers for their actions.
								It encourages customers to interact with your business, earn
								points, and compete for exciting rewards.

							<h3>1.1. What is the reward race program ?</h3>
							<p>
								The Reward Race program is a fun and engaging loyalty system
								designed to help merchants reward customers for their actions.
								It encourages customers to interact with your business, earn
								points, and compete for exciting rewards.
							</p>

						<section id="section-1-2">
							<h3>1.2. What makes us unique</h3>
							<p>
								Our system offers
								<strong>four key features— Reward Program, VIP Program, Referral
									Program, and Survey Program—</strong>
								designed to help merchants easily reward their customers and
								boost engagement. Here's how each feature works and how you
								can use them to award points:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>1. Reward Program: </strong>Encourage everyday
									customer actions like purchases or social media
									interactions.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Example: </strong>A customer spends $50 at your
									store and earns 500 points, which they can later use to get
									a 10% discount.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>1. VIP Program: </strong>Reward your most loyal
									customers with exclusive benefits. Set different VIP tiers
									(e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum) based on customer spending or
									points earned. Offer extra rewards, such as bonus points,
									early access to sales, or special gifts for higher tiers.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Example: </strong>A customer who earns 1,000 points
									in a month qualifies for the Gold tier and receives double
									points on all purchases for the next month.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>1. Referral Program: </strong>Grow your customer
									base through word-of-mouth marketing. Provide customers with
									a unique referral code or link. When someone uses their code
									to make a purchase, both the referrer and the new customer
									earn points.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Example: </strong>A customer refers a friend who
									spends $30. The customer earns 300 points, and the friend
									gets a welcome bonus of 100 points.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>1. Survey Program: </strong>Collect valuable
									feedback while rewarding customers for their input. Create
									surveys about your products or services. Offer points to
									customers who complete the surveys, encouraging
									participation.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Example: </strong>A customer fills out a feedback
									form about their shopping experience and earns 50 points.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</section>

						<section id="section-1-3">

									referrals, and more. Stay updated on every interaction
									within your program.

									customer behavior, and ROI. Make data-driven decisions with

									colors, and themes. Create a seamless, branded experience
									for your customers.

									and activity history. Strengthen your relationships with
									personalized rewards.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>6. Import/Export Tools:</strong>

									offline analysis. Keep your workflow efficient and
									organized.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>7. Onsite Content:</strong>
									Engage your customers with banners, pop-ups, and widgets
									directly on your website. Promote your loyalty program
									effortlessly.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>8. Automated Email Notifications:</strong>

									rewards, and exclusive offers, driving continued engagement.

								a limit on the shipping value that the coupon will cover. For
								example, if the maximum shipping amount is set to 1 BDT, the
								free shipping coupon will cover shipping costs up to 1 BDT.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Let’s say you set the Points Cost to 100 points, and the
									Maximum Shipping Amount to 50 BDT.
								</li>
								<li>
									If a customer redeems 100 points, they can get a free
									shipping coupon that covers shipping fees up to 50 BDT.
								</li>
								<li>
									If their shipping cost is 40 BDT, the entire cost will be
									covered. However, if the shipping cost is 60 BDT, the coupon
									will only cover 50 BDT, and the customer will need to pay
									the remaining 10 BDT.
								</li>
							</ul>

								<strong>3. Reward Expiration for Free Shipping Coupon </strong>In this section, you can
								choose whether the free shipping
								coupon reward should have an expiration date or remain valid
								permanently. You have two main options:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<strong>No Expiration: </strong>Select this option if you
									want the free shipping coupon to remain valid permanently.
									Customers will be able to redeem the coupon at any time
									without a set expiration date.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Set Expiration Period: </strong>If you prefer to
									limit how long the coupon is valid, select this option and
									choose a specific expiration period (e.g., 10 days, 30 days,
									etc.). This ensures that the coupon can only be used within
									the specified timeframe, encouraging customers to use the
									reward promptly.
